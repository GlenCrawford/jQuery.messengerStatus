At the moment, this plugin is finished, although the Windows Live APIs are changing very quickly recently, so I will return to it someday to make sure it still works.

The index.html file is a working demo, and it will display the status of my Windows Live account. Clicking the notification will alert out all the data that Microsoft returns about you. Note that by design, you won't see a thing if I'm not online in some form (active, away, busy, et cetera).

Full documentation will be forthcoming when I have time.
